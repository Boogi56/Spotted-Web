# Spotted Web App
An app built at PennApps XVIII that helps to locate victims of flooding and connect them to volunteers using image recognition on a drone. Not meant to be a fully-finished product, instead, this is meant to be used as part of a proof of concept.

[Run the example live](http://sean-kelly.tech/Spotted-Web/) or [see the polished mobile app](https://github.com/vansh1sh/HackForResilience).
